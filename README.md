# Pohlig_hellman
Pohlig hellman algorithm for solving discret logarithm problem when p-1 has small factors

Can't find a working implementation of Pohlig Hellman so I created mine.

Juste replace p, h and g to get x in h = g^x [p]

Todo : Don't decompose p-1 like this but try to use factordb instead
